	Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is an authoring tool that is used in creating Internet Web pages. When using HTML a block of text is surrounded with tags that indicate to an Internet browser how the text is to appear (for example, in bold face or italics). HTML is a collection of platform-independent styles (indicated by markup tags) that define the various components of a Web document. It is the preferred tool for creating Web pages because it is understood by all Internet browsers. Many Web designers who use HTML find it simple to learn and easy to use, because it offers a stripped-down approach to Web design that does not rely a lot on extraneous features. Another aspect of its popularity is its ability to deal quickly with bandwidth-friendly text documents.
